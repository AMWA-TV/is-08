# AMWA NMOS Device Audio Channel Mapping Specification: Overview

## Documentation

The documents included in this directory provide additional details and recommendations for implementations of the defined API, and its consumers.

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explain how an NMOS compatible system can re-map audio channels. This can take place on a sending device, where the resulting re-mapped audio may be sent out over the broadcast network, or a receiving device, where audio received from the broadcast network may be re-mapped prior to consumption.

The terms 'Node', 'Device', 'Sender' and 'Receiver' will be used extensively throughout this document. Please refer to the core [NMOS Technical Overview](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos/blob/master/NMOS%20Technical%20Overview.md) for definitions of these.

This API is intended to be used in conjunction with an [NMOS IS-04 Discovery & Registration](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-discovery-registration) deployment, however it has been written in such a way to provide useful functionality even in the absence of such a system.

This API may also be used on a Device with an [NMOS IS-05 Device Connection Management](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-device-connection-management) interface, but still provides useful functionality when used on Devices where connections are established by other means.

## Use of Normative Language
The documents included in this Dictory form a normative part of the specification, along with the API definitions and schemas included in the [APIs directory](../APIs).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL, "NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

## Terminology

The API may be used to define a mapping between one or more audio "Inputs" and one or more audio "Outputs". Inputs and Outputs are local resources to the device, and as such are not published to the registry. An Input can be assigned audio from an NMOS Receiver, or can represent audio sources from elsewhere (e.g a microphone or physical input). Similarly an audio routed to an Output can be assigned to an NMOS Source, or can be consumed elsewhere (e.g be routed to a loudspeaker or a physical output).

It is recognised that a Node may not be able to arbitrarily route audio from any Input to any Output. As such the API allows the Device it is running on to express these limitations.

Inputs and Outputs both have a number of Channels available for use. An input either represents each of the audio tracks assigned to it as a Channel, or a sub-set of them. The number of channels an Input or Output has can be restricted by the Device, or it can be defined by the user if permitted by the Device.

The relationship between Input channels and Output channels is defined by the "Map". Where a given Input is routable to a given output, it MUST be possible to route any input channel to any output channel. Output channels that do not have any Input channels routed to them are said to be "parked".

The API has two representations or the Map. The Active Map describes the current channel mapping state of the Device. The Staged Map represents the intended state of the Device at some future point. An "Activation" is the process whereby the Staged Map transitions to being the Active map. At the time of activation the undertlying audio channel mapping behaviour of the Device transitions to reflect the new state of the Active map.

An Activation my either by "immediate", "relatively scheduled" or "absolutely scheduled". Immediate activations are carried out as soon as possible after the request to carry them out has been received. A relatively sheduled activiation is carried out after a period of time specified by the client has ellapsed. An absolute activation is carried out at a specific time specified by the client.

## API Structure

The API is divided into the following parts:

### Map
This contains the two states of the Map, staged and active. The Staged Map is modifiable by the client through use of the HTTP PATCH method. The Active Map is not directly modifiable by the client - changes must be made by modifying the Staged Map and then performing an activation.

### Inputs
This resource enbumerates all of the inputs, and contains further endpoints which expose information and configuration relating to the Device's inputs.

### Outputs
Equivilant to the inputs resource but for outputs - enumerates and contains information and configuration for all Device Outputs.

### IO
This is simply a view onto data available elsewhere into the API, in order to allow clients to gather the information they need about inputs and outputs in a single request.
