# Interoperability: NMOS IS-04

_(c) AMWA 2017, CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_

The Connection Management API shares a data model with the NMOS IS-04 specification, and as a result it is designed to be used alongside it. The following implementation notes identify correct behaviour for doing this.

When this API is used alongside IS-04 in a deployment, the IS-04 APIs should be operating at version 1.2 or greater in order to ensure full interoperability.

## Discovery

The Audio Channel Mapping API should be advertised as a 'control' endpoint when publishing a compliant NMOS Device. By using the common type 'urn:x-nmos:control:cm-ctrl/v1.0', control interfaces can identify all Devices which implement the Connection Management API, and the URLs required to access them.

**Example:** The 'controls' attribute of a single NMOS Device
```
...
"controls": [
  {
    "type": "urn:x-nmos:control:channel-mapping/v1.0",
    "href": "http://192.168.10.3/x-nmos/channelmapping/v1.0/"
  }
]
...
```

Note as above that the API version is included in the 'type', and in the 'href'. As new versions of the Audio Channel API are published, further control endpoints may be advertised for Devices which support multiple versions simultaneously.

More details about multi-version support can be found in [5.0. Upgrade Path](5.0.%20Upgrade%20Path.md).

A given instance of the  Audio Channel Mapping API may offer control of multiple Devices in a Node from a single URI. Alternatively there may be multiple instances of the API on one Node, each corresponding to one Device. A seperate 'control' endpoint for each Device's API instance must be advertised, even if the URI is the same.

## Receiver and Input Relationship


## Receiver and Source IDs

The Source and Receiver UUIDs used in the API to identify relationships to Inputs and Outputs must match those used in a corresponding IS-04 implementation.

## Version Increments

In order to prevent unnecessary polling of the Audio Channel Mapping API, changes to active map parameters of Source connected Outputs MUST be signalled via the IS-04 versioning mechanism.
