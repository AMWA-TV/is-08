# [Work In Progress] AMWA NMOS Audio Channel Mapping Specification Architecture Blueprint Examples

This folder contains samples that go with the architecture blueprint posted on Basecamp. The samples are split in the following folders:
- **Tagging** - Samples that illustrate different use cases for using JSON based metadata to describe the content of an audio stream
- **Simple - Speaker** - Sample that show how a mapper resource might be applied to a simple device
- **Complex - Mapper** - Sample that show how a mapper resource might be applied to a complex device

These samples contain multiple JSON objects in a simple file for practical reasons. Proper API definitions (RAML & JSON Schema) and examples will be developed at a later stage
