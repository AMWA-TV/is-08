<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Allows channel-level operations within NMOS environments
  - For example: muting channels, swapping languages…

### Why does it matter?

- Provides expected functionality for typical production/broadcast operations
- Extends usefulness of IS-05 and other NMOS specs.

### How does it work?

- Controller gets channel information from sending Node
  - …and sends mapping information to the receiving Node
- Can also do sender-side mapping
